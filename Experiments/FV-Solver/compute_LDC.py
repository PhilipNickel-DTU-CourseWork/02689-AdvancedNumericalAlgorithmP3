"""
Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Computation
===================================

This script computes the lid-driven cavity flow problem using a finite volume
method with the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling.

The problem is solved on a collocated grid with:
- Reynolds number: Re = 100
- Grid resolution: 64x64 cells
- Relaxation factors: α_uv = 0.6, α_p = 0.2
