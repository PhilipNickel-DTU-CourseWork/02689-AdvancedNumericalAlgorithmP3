# schafer_turek_2D2 Experiment

Benchmark case for transient flow around a cylinder at Re=100, based on Schäfer and Turek (1996).

## Mesh Types

- **unstructured**: Unstructured mesh with a circular obstacle, matching the DFG 2D-2 benchmark geometry.

## Resolutions
- **coarse**: Lower resolution for quick tests
- **medium**: Balanced resolution for most simulations
- **fine**: Higher resolution for detailed flow features


## File Format
- **.msh**: Gmsh format with boundary tags
- **.vtu**: VTU format for ParaView
